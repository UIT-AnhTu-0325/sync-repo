- Main app
    + build service use .NETcore + React
    + devide small module instead of micro service
        => mono easier to build & maintenance
    + each module use simple clean architechture
        => three main layer: controller, service, repository
    + module 1 -> business module, CRUD follow user requirement
        from Business Op => Business plan => Service Request
        =>Estimated Settlement => Contract => Quotation => Settlement

        -> include report page, manage item status by rabbitmq
            main service action => push message 
            => other message will consume & update status
            => reduce task for main service
    + module 2 -> approval wf: every item have the approval workflow,
        in some step will need someone approve, reject or return it
        
        => have approval procedure, approval approver, approval approving
        approval step...
    + module 3 -> integration: every item action will integrate with 
        workit system, need update realtime & not block main service
        => new simple system have controller & service
        => many request need handler => rabbitmq will help us to manage those
        => main service will make Http call (for easy expand or integrate with other service)
        => consume message & get system status => call 3rd API
